# URL Screenshot Plugin

This application allows you to take screenshots of a website.

## Main features:

- To be able to take screenshots of given URL in different viewports.

## Nice to have features:

- Allow for different type of screenshots:
  -> grayscale,
  -> contrast colours,
  -> colors for different type of eyesight for individuals with different levels of eyesight

## UI Design

- UI should be adjustable horizontally and verticially like devtools
- UI should look like the devtools bar:

  - ![alt text](/images/bar.png)

- the applicaiton UI should resemble the devtools bar + options + more? or + less

  - ![alt text](/images/scene.png)

  - The ability to `throttle a network`, in a screenshot like app. or plugin, can represent screenshots of the diff. states of a websites load.
    - Linked to Lighthouse `loading times`, `rendering`
    - Essentially what browser already offers just diff. just needs to be reapplied to something new old invention applied to something new; new use case, new problem, etc.

- Figma plugin UI ideas:
  - the screenshot ability should be reachable via CTRL + P
  - it should be a bar at the top but it should
    - go invisible or,
    - becomes really small line, like -------- or,
    - but its hover area (opacity:0) will be great so as soon as you move mouse towards it, opacity:1 really low opacity so its transparent
